This a GPT-2 model training project using RTX4090.

The used dataset is the **train.json** file in the **data** folder, a fiction, named **Ordinary World**

The config info about this training is in the **config** foler.

The **mnt** folder contains all of results.

The number of epoch I set is 100, hence the original model folder is very huge, so I just upload the final model.
